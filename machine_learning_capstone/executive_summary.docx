Executive Summary

Hospital Rating Classification dataset consists of 3057 rows and 94 columns. The dataset provides features and ratings of different hospitals. The ratings of hospitals range from 0 to 5 and the most common rating is 3. The rating is highly correlated on the patient experience and negatively correlated with readmission sub-measures. The top three states with highest ratings are California, Pennsylvania and Texas which had more voluntary hospitals.
	The following is a classification problem where an input of all the features will be provided and the predicted output is either 0 or 1. For ratings below or equal to 3, the predicted output is classified as 0 and for ratings above 3, the predicted output is classified as 1.
	Three models were chosen for the dataset - Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision Tree. The Logistic Regression outperformed the other two datasets with around 95% accuracy which is more than 10% than the other two models. The root mean squared error is the lowest for the Logistic regression model with 0.21. The F1, Recall and Precision scores for the Logistic Regression Model was more than 90% on the validation data.
	The final test data had 6 records out of which 2 records were classified as rating above 3 and others were classified as rating below or equal to 3. The top 3 measures accounting for bad ratings were Readmission, Timelessness of care comparison and experience. Good ratings were provided due to safety and mortality measures.
	In conclusion, the measures that need to be checked in poor performing hospitals are readmission, timelessness of care comparison and experience. Under readmission, the sub-measures READM_30_HOSP_WIDE_Score, READM_30_COPD_Score and READM_30_PN_Score. Similarly, under experience, EXP_H_STAR_RATING_Score sub-measure needs to be checked by the hospitals on priority. Hospitals also need to be careful that their good performance measures are not impacted.
